<p>The task inthis exercise is to write my own function that accepts the current month as a parameter and prints one of the following
responses, depending on whether it is July or not:</p>
<p> if it is july, it will respond: "It's July, so it can get really hot."</p>
<p> if it is another month, it will respond: "It's not July, so at least we're not in the peak of the heat."</p><br>

<p>So, the response given by the code, is as follows:</P>



<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
var months=new Date().getMonth();
julymonth(months);     /*invoking/calling function*/
function julymonth(d) {
if (d ==6) {
   document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "It's July, so it can get really hot.";
}
else {
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "It’s not July, so at least we’re not in the peak of the heat.";
}}
</script>
</body>
